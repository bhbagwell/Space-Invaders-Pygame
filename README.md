# Space-Invaders-Pygame
Creating the game Space Invaders using Pygame Module in Python

This is a simple Space Invaders game that our team decided to choose. The main changes that have been made center around altering the PNG files that exist for
the player and enemy pieces, as well as some of the WAV files for the background music and in game sound effects.
